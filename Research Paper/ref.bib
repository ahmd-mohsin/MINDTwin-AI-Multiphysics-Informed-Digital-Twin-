Their damage creates cyclic efforts which are at the origin of the processing of vibratory measurements. This processing can be made by temporal methods, frequential methods, or by time-scale methods using the wavelets for 2 decades. The wavelet transform is a very effective processing, however, the difficulties of application and interpretation of the results slow down their employment. The determination of the parameters of the wavelets makes its use all the more difficult. Moreover, the use of these time-scale methods is very expensive in time computation. This paper proposes a wavelet adapted to the mechanical shock response of a structure with n degrees of freedom. In addition, we developed a procedure for analysis of signals by this wavelet which makes it possible to accelerate the process and to improve detection in the case of disturbed signals. This methodology is compared with the traditional time-scale methods and is implemented to detect defects of different sizes on outer rings and inner rings of ball bearings.}",

abstract = {The demand for electricity is growing very fast; as a result, the entire power sector is facing a real problem of meeting the additional demand. Rigorous energy audit suggests the replacement of energy-efficient devices from standard one, operating with poor efficiency and consumes large power. 3-phase induction motor is widely used as driving power in most of the industries and it consumes almost 65% of the total power. The energy-efficient design of such motors saves a considerable amount of energy and reduces the cost of operation. In this paper, an attempt has been made to design energy-efficient induction motor from different perspective of using design and optimization without high-quality material. In this paper, the cost of yearly energy losses is considered as objective function and it is optimized to save energy and money as well. The design problem is a nonlinear constraint optimization problem, which involves many variables and constraints. Water Cycle Algorithm (WCA) is one of the most recently developed metaheuristic algorithm is taken for the optimization for the case study of 5 HP and 10 HP, 3- phase, Squirrel cage induction motor. The objective function is optimized by WCA and Genetic Algorithm and their result is compared for accuracy from cost and performance point of view. WCA found to be the most efficient tool to optimize the problem and helps to design an energy-efficient motor.}

ABSTRACT = {Induction motors play a key role in the industrial sector. Thus, the correct diagnosis and classification of faults on these machines are important, even in the initial stages of evolution. Such analysis allows for increased productivity, avoids unexpected process interruptions, and prevents damage to machines. Usually, fault diagnosis is carried out by analyzing the characteristic effects caused by the faults. Thus, it is necessary to know and understand the behavior during the operation of the faulty machine. In general, monitoring these characteristics is complex, as it is necessary to acquire signals from the same motor with and without failures for comparison purposes. Whether in an industrial environment or in laboratories, the experimental characterization of failures can become unfeasible for several reasons. Thus, computer simulation of faulty motors digital twins can be an important alternative for failure analysis, especially in large motors. From this perspective, this paper presents and discusses several limitations found in the technical literature that can be minimized with the implementation of digital twins. In addition, a 3D finite element model of an induction motor with broken rotor bars is demonstrated, and motor current signature analysis is used to verify the fault effects. Results are analyzed in the time and frequency domain. Additionally, an artificial neural network of the multilayer perceptron type is used to classify the failure of broken bars in the 3D model rotor.},

abstract = {The 4th industrial revolution requires the tracking and optimization of energy consumption using an intelligent energy management system (IEMS). Such a system needs accurate real-time energy information to operate industrial machines, where Induction Motors (IMs) represent 42.2% of the global energy consumption. This paper addresses the problems of data acquisition for Induction motors in the context of Industry 4.0 (I4.0) where precision, real-time constraints, and optimal operations play a major role in decision-making. A new vision of Digital Shadow (DS) is proposed for the energy efficiency (EE) of IMs. A hybrid model consisting of a data-driven model and a physics-based model is developed to represent the machine efficiency information in real-time (RT). The proposed method is developed based on a two-stage procedure. Firstly, the IM EE model is established by considering Stator joule losses, core losses, rotor joule losses, friction, and windage losses, in addition to the stray losses to create an improved model. This was established based on the double cage model where core loss resistance is added. Secondly, the machine’s losses and efficiency are visualized using the 8 electrical circuit parameters (ECP) from the double cage model in addition to the rated speed and test temperature. The parameters estimation in RT incurred complexities and required the use of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)-based modeling. The proposed model was developed using Fuzzy Logic Toolbox and Neuro-Fuzzy Designer app from MATLAB by training Sugeno systems. 8 ANFIS MATLAB models are trained to estimate each of the 8 ECP from the double cage model by using standard inputs. The training and testing dataset is constituted by the experimental data of the ECPs were calculated using the FSOLVE function to solve the nonlinear system formed by 60 motors from 8 manufacturers’ data such as voltage, number of pole-pairs, rated output power, rated torque, current, starting current, maximum torque and the power factor. Finally, the proposed method is validated experimentally using a 1.5 KW, 400/230 V, 50 Hz squirrel cage induction motor (SCIM) for linear speed control. The EE, Torque, and losses are visualized through the proposed model using MATLAB/SIMULINK. The mean value of the RMSE for the eight estimated ECPs are 7.57e-05, and 5.73e-01 respectively for training and testing while the mean values of the MAE are 2.06e-05, and 3.79e-01 respectively for training and testing. The errors of the EE estimation w.r.t the measured EE at rated condition, are RMSE = 0.205, and MAE = 0.1671. These results show that the proposed model can be implemented in the industry to monitor the machine EE and its losses.}
